## Invistigation of slenderness and element size on modal analysis of the comparison between Timoshenko Beam in FEM and Analytical E-B Beam

### Test Cases:
- S-S
- Fixed-Fixed
- Free-Free
- Fixed-Free

###  The relationship of slenderness and similarity of Timoshenko and E-B Beam 
#### 3D plot: X = i-th modes, Y = element size, Z = Error
#### Sensitivity Analysis of Slenderness along i-th modes
