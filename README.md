## Invistigation of slenderness and element size on modal analysis of the comparison between Timoshenko Beam in FEM and Analytical E-B Beam

### Test Cases:
- S-S
- Fixed-Fixed
- Fixed-Free

###  The relationship of slenderness and similarity of Timoshenko and E-B Beam 

#### Known problems in comparison:
- element size
- L/T ratio
- Slenderness considering E and nu
- Convergence
#### 3D plot: X = i-th modes, Y = element size, Z = Error compared to E-B result

#### 3D plot: X = i-th modes, Y = slenderness (L/T), Z = Error compared to E-B result
- Assume the element size is fix

#### 3D plot: X = i-th modes, Y = element size when start convergence,   Z = L/T
#### 3D plot: X = i-th modes, Y = sensitivity on natural frequency on (L/T/E/W/rho/nu), Z = level
- Assume the element size is fix
